// This file can be used for common type definitions across the EcoPlay application.

// Example:
// export interface PlayerStats {
//   id: string;
//   balance: number;
//   gameHistory: Array<{ game: string; score: number }>;
// }

// For now, it's empty as game-specific types are handled within their respective pages.
// As the app grows, common types can be centralized here.
